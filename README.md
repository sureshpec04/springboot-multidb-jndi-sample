# springboot-multidb-jndi-sample
Spring Boot sample to connect multiple DB using JNDI lookup. 
This project uses Spring Data JPA to connect 3 different data sources. In this example, I have used MySQL database but it should work for others as well.

JNDI configuration used in the code refers to JNDI datasource already exists in Application server. In my case it is JBOSS EAP 7.
Please modify this according to your requirement.
